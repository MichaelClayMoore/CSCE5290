## Questions:

### 1. Why we use stopwords? Why stopwords are not necessary for NLP frequency distribution.

**Stopwords are used to make conversations flow easier. We don’t use them in the frequency distribution because they don’t add value to the text, and thus aren’t relevant.**

### 2. Based on high frequency words what information you can extract from the graph?

**I can see that SpaceX had a launch a ship (falcon) in sometimes from February to May.**

### 3. Can you provide different visualization for frequency distribution? If yes, please perform. If no, why?

**Yes, see below**
